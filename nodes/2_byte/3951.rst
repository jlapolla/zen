Fixing defensive programming antipatterns
=========================================

Pretend your name is James, and you're a proponent of defensive programming. You
probably write code like this:

.. code:: python

  # Python code.

  def sqrt(x):

      if x < 0:
          raise Exception('domain error')

      # Fancy square root code here!
      # ...
      return result

During a code review, your coworker, Octavius, points out that you didn't check
if ``x`` was a number. "What if I pass a string?" he asks. He has a point.
"Okay, let me update ``sqrt()``" you reply.

.. code:: python

  # Python code.

  def sqrt(x):

      if not (isinstance(x, int) or isinstance(x, float)):
          raise Exception('not a number')

      if x < 0:
          raise Exception('domain error')

      # Fancy square root code here!
      # ...
      return result

You're pleased with yourself. Octavius raises his hand again: "James, what if I
pass a list of numbers?" he asks. You think about what should happen if client
code passes a list to ``sqrt()``. "Well, if the client passes a list of numbers,
I suppose I should return a list of their square roots" you reply.

.. code:: python

  # Python code.

  def sqrt(x):

      if isinstance(x, list):
          return map(sqrt, x)

      if not (isinstance(x, int) or isinstance(x, float)):
          raise Exception('not a number')

      if x < 0:
          raise Exception('domain error')

      # Fancy square root code here!
      # ...
      return result

You're pleaed with yourself again. But Octavius raises his hand again: "What if
I pass a string?" You consider it for a moment, and reply "Well, I suppose I
could try to convert it to a number."

.. code:: python

  # Python code.

  def sqrt(x):

      if isinstance(x, list):
          return map(sqrt, x)

      if isinstance(x, str):
          return sqrt(float(x))

      if not (isinstance(x, int) or isinstance(x, float)):
          raise Exception('not a number')

      if x < 0:
          raise Exception('domain error')

      # Fancy square root code here!
      # ...
      return result

Finally, Octavius is satisfied. ``sqrt()`` rejects all inputs that are not
numbers, unless the input is a list, in which case it applies ``sqrt()`` to
every member of the list. Or if the input is a string, it converts it to a
number, and applies ``sqrt()``. It seems bullet proof. It even has the added
benefit that it will handle a list of strings!

Separating responsibilities
===========================

Now I'm going to propose that we make ``sqrt()`` even more modular. Let's
decompose it into a suite of related functions. Our goal is to give each
function a single responsibility. That way, our code follows the `single
responsibility principle`_.

.. _`single responsibility principle`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle

As a first step, we pull out the argument checks into a separate function.

.. code:: python

  # Python code.

  def checked_sqrt(x):

      if isinstance(x, list):
          return map(checked_sqrt, x)

      if isinstance(x, str):
          return checked_sqrt(float(x))

      if not (isinstance(x, int) or isinstance(x, float)):
          raise Exception('not a number')

      if x < 0:
          raise Exception('domain error')

      return sqrt(x)

  def sqrt(x):

      # Fancy square root code here!
      # ...
      return result

Next, we'll separate the type detection from the action performed on each type.

.. code:: python

  # Python code.

  def checked_sqrt(x):

      if isinstance(x, list):
          return sqrt_list(x)

      if isinstance(x, str):
          return sqrt_str(x)

      if not (isinstance(x, int) or isinstance(x, float)):
          raise Exception('not a number')

      if x < 0:
          raise Exception('domain error')

      return sqrt(x)

  def sqrt_list(x):
      return map(checked_sqrt, x)

  def sqrt_str(x):
      return checked_sqrt(float(x))

  def sqrt(x):

      # Fancy square root code here!
      # ...
      return result
